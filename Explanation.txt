Sagar is developing a bit manipulation machine, so he wants to find longest distance between two consecutive 1's in the binary representation of the given number
If there aren't two consecutive 1's, return 0.

Input Description:
n an integer

Output Description:
longest distance between two consecutive 1's in the binary representation of n

Sample Input:
12

Sample Output:
1

Explanation:
the binary representation of 12 is 1100,
so the lonest distance between two consecutive 1's is 1

Sample Input:
8

Sample Output:
0

Sample Input:
34

Sample Output:
4

Sample Input:
21

Sample Output:
2

Sample Input:
77

Sample Output:
3
